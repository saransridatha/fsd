# Learnings from a Simple React SPA

This project is a simple single-page application (SPA) built with React and Vite. It demonstrates the following concepts:

- **Project Setup with Vite:** The project was initialized and set up using Vite, a modern and fast build tool for web development.
- **Single-Page Application (SPA) with React Router:** The application uses `react-router-dom` to create a single-page experience. This allows for navigation between different "pages" (components) without a full page reload.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** The application is structured into different components (`Home`, `About`, `Contact`), which is a core concept in React development.
- **Production Build:** A production-ready build of the application was created using `npm run build`, which bundles and optimizes the code for deployment.
