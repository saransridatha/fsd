# Experiment-4 — State Management

Learning outcomes:

1. Understand local state in React using `useState` and component-level updates.
2. Use React Context API to create a simple global state provider and consumer.
3. Implement a reducer-based global store pattern with `useReducer` and Context.
4. Compare local state, Context API, and reducer-based global state approaches.
5. Wire providers into the app entry point and verify components consume shared state.
