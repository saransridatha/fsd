# Experiment 5: Lazy Loading in React

## Learning Outcomes

1. Understand the concept of code splitting and lazy loading in React applications to improve performance.
2. Implement React.lazy() to dynamically import components and reduce initial bundle size.
3. Use the Suspense component to handle loading states for lazy-loaded components.
4. Optimize React applications by strategically applying lazy loading to non-critical components.
